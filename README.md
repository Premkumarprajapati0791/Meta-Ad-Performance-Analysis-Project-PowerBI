📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1.Impressions: 216K: Total times the ads were shown. Good reach. 
2.Clicks: 25.4K: Number of people who clicked on the ads. 
3.Shares: 1.3K, Comments: 2.6K: Indicators of organic engagement (beyond paid reach).
4.Purchases (Conversions): 1.3K: Real customer acquisitions from ads. 
5.Engagements: 29K: Sum of clicks, likes, shares, comments. 
6.CTR (Click-Through Rate): 11.76%: Strong performance (above industry average ~1-2%). Ads are very attractive. 
7.Engagement Rate: 13.56%: Very healthy; content resonates with the audience. 
8.Conversion Rate: 5.21%: Out of all clicks, 5.21% converted into purchases. Good but could improve with landing page optimization. 
9.Purchase Rate: 0.61%: Out of impressions, only 0.61% resulted in purchases. Low conversion funnel efficiency (room to optimize). 
10.Total Budget: 2.5M: Total ad spends. 
11.Avg Budget per Campaign: 50.7K: Suggests multiple campaigns were run.

Insight: Ads are performing strongly in visibility and engagement, but actual purchase efficiency is weak: need to optimize targeting/landing pages. 
1.High CTR (11.76%) and Engagement Rate (13.56%) → clearly indicate that the ad 
creatives, messaging, and targeting at the top of the funnel are very effective. 
2.People are interested enough to click, like, share, or comment. 
3.Low Purchase Rate (0.61%) and only 1.3K conversions out of 216K impressions 
→ shows a sharp drop-off in the lower funnel. This is a classic case of "awareness 
and interest" being strong but "action (purchase)" being weak.
